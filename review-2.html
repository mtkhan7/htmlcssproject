      3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in
      terms of productivity and efficiency â€“ could you have been more efficient
      when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?
    </h2>
    <p>
      I.T tools and systems are very effective in increasing productivity.
      Within the development of my website, I had used Trello boards which was
      beneficial in allowing me to plan the project, however I did not use it to
      its full potential. I could have increased productivity by developing the
      website in a team and using Trello more collaboratively. This would have
      benefited communication and sharing the workload of developing a website.
      Another IT tools such as Slack could have been used if working amongst a
      team. This would have allowed me to communicate and share files with
      others allowing increased efficiency.
    </p>
    <h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>
    <p>
      To improve productivity and efficiency, It is necessary to be well
      organised and have the right tools and equipment in order to ensure a
      successful project. Delegating work is essential on delivering a big
      project as this will allow multiple tasks to be distributed and therefore
      completed in a timely manner. Another way to improve productivity is to
      set realistic goals. This will allow individuals to set achievable
      outcomes. For productivity and efficiency it is vital to receive feedback
      so that changes can be implemented. It's also recommended to take small
      breaks and keep well hydrated .
    </p>
    <h2>
      3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital
      projects
    </h2>
    <p>
      In order to improve productivity I will plan and set realistic goals. I
      will ensure I have the right tools and support network in order to ensure
      a successful project, for example working in a team and using I.T tools
      such as Slack. Slack allows effective communication by replacing
      conventional methods such as emails as it is instant communication saving
      time. Another I.T tool I will use is Github, this will allow project and
      code sharing as each individual can see the project and make changes where
      necessary, therefore increasing productivity and efficiency in a timely
      manner.
    </p>
    <h2>
      3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions
    </h2>
    <p>
      When creating digital solutions, there are various ways to test software.
      The Most common method being unit testing. Unit testing is used to check
      whether the program is functioning as intended. It involves breaking down
      the program into smaller sections and testing them individually. If all
      the parts of the program pass the testing it is likely that the software
      will work as intended.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another way to test whether the program functions as designed is to
      initiate a system test also known as black box testing. This is used for
      testing the overall application to ensure the application works as
      intended. However this method should not be relied upon as it may miss
      smaller bugs or faults in the code. To ensure that the completion of the
      project is suitable, it can be tested by feedback of the target audience,
      however, if there is no specific client you must consider yourself whether
      the finished project is simple and user friendly.
