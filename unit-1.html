  <h2>1.1 Purpose of Information Technology in modern business</h2>
  <p>
    Inofrmation Technology has a huge purpose and value in modern
    businesses. In recent years the purpose of I.T in modern businesses have
    played a big role in companies being more productive by using state of
    the art software and hardware in automating the process required by
    businesses. I.T has enabled big companies such as Amazon, Microsoft,
    Google to solve complex problems at a quicker pace. There is benefit for
    businesses when using I.T as companies are able to use improved hardware
    such as more memory, faster processor and more storage. This allows them
    to be able to complete multiple tasks at a quicker rate which would
    allow them to be cost efficient and make more sales which will lead to
    more profit for the business.
  </p>
  <p>
    Implementing the use of Information technology in businesses have also
    allowed them to make better decisions by doing market research online or
    offline and efficiently obtaining data with utilizing applications like
    <a href="https://dynamics.microsoft.com/" target="_blank"
      >Microsoft CRM Dynamics</a
    >,
    <a href="https://analytics.google.com/" target="_blank"
      >Google Analytics</a
    >
    <a
      href="https://www.business2community.com/tech-gadgets/importance-information-technology-business-today-01393380"
      target="_blank"
      >[2]</a
    >
    This will enable the business to be able to identify what their
    customers needs and wants are and how they can supply them with products
    fitting their demand. By doing this the business would be able to
    provide products which customers prefer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Information technology has also resulted in improving customer support
    by utilising multiple channels such as smartphones, emails, social media
    platforms. There are also cloud technologies which are easily available
    today and have helped many businesses be able to manage their resources
    in an efficient manner, cut costs and have allowed their employees to
    use any devices anywhere in the world to access their enterprise
    software<a
      href="https://www.business2community.com/tech-gadgets/importance-information-technology-business-today-01393380"
      target="_blank"
      >[2]</a
    >.By doing this businesses are able to be well organised and have a
    systematic structure allowing them to be more cost efficient. Due to
    high competition in the business sector, being cost efficient will give
    businesses the upper hand and it is evident by companies such as Apple
    and Samsung, having advanced I.T features allows them to take control of
    the market and therefore having huge market share in smartphones.

      1.2 methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects
      successfully
    </h2>
    <p>
      Since digital projects require a lot of time and attention there are
      numerous skills and tools which are essential to complete these tasks
      successfully. There should be a detailed plan for implementation of
      the idea<a
      href="https://blog.forecast.it/5-steps-to-managing-a-digital-project"
      target="_blank"
    >[4]</a
    >, this is essential as you are able to plan in manageable
      steps. Planning is crucial as a digital project would require an
      individual to face multiple scenarios and a plan allows one to be time
      efficient.
    </p>

    <p>
      A digital project being produced in regards to a client, it is
      essential to understand the requirements, time constraints and costs
      and limitations of the project. Clients have demands which have to be
      met in order for the project to be successful. Therefore being aware
      of the requirements and understanding how to accomplish them is an
      essential skill to complete a project.
    </p>
    
    
    Digital projects have a number of different forms, such as a web
    application or a desktop app. It is crucial to be aware of what
    technologies or development stack to use specifically for the product
    and whether there needs to be a collaboration with user design and
    development teams. Alongside being aware of this, having interpersonal
    and teamwork skills to deal with clients or your team is also an
    essential skill in order to achieve a successful digital project. 
  </p>
  <p>This
    would therefore require good knowledge of communication tools such as
    slack, flock, google hangout that allow messaging, file and code sharing
    between teams.  Having knowledge of tools such as
    <a href="http://www.trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</a>,
    <a href="http://www.asana.com"  target="_blank">Asana</a>,
    <a href="http://www.monday.com"  target="_blank">Monday</a>
    for project management in conjunction with
    the use of agile software development methodologies such as Kanban
    and Scrum<a
    href="https://blog.forecast.it/5-steps-to-managing-a-digital-project"
    target="_blank">[5]</a> are must have in order to achieve a successful project.</p>
    <p>
    These tools aid in the planning,development, testing and the deployment
    of the end product . Other tools such as draw.io and lucidchart allow
    the creation of diagrams and flowcharts for the product. This would once
    again be time efficient and allow the needs of the client to be met
    efficiently.</p>
    <p> Another essential skill required is to be able to use
    programming and scripting languages such as
    
    <a href="http://www.python.com" taget="_blank">Python</a>
    <a href="http://www.javascript.info" taget="_blank">Javascript</a>
    <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com" taget="_blank">C++</a>
    
    for coding and
    developing the product. After developing the product, you must test the
    product and in order to do this, one must require knowledge of different
    tools and skills such as reviewing peer code, bug testing, usability
    testing and use of testing applications[1]. Applying these tools and
    skills would allow a project to be created efficiently and therefore
    being successful in meeting its end goal.</p>

<h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.
</h2>
<p>
In order to develop my website, I will devise a plan by brainstorming the structure and design, wire-frames of the website either on paper or using a tool such as draw.io. This will allow me to create a diagram and a user interface of the front end which will identify where each element is positioned on the website e.g content, navigation, links, images and buttons. In order for efficient and effective development of my website, I will break down the project into small manageable tasks. I will use trello with the kanban method for tracking my progress. This will allow me to prioritise important aspects of the website development, allowing me to finish the website within my designated time and updating the board as I progress. <a
href="https://trello.com/b/kuLFRFKG/portfolio-research-mk"
target="_blank"
>Trello Link
</a>   </p> 
<p>
The tools that I have considered are HTML for the structure of the website, CSS for styling and Javascript for manipulating web behaviour. The website will be coded in VS Code editor. On completion of the website, I will review the code and start testing each function for bugs. This is vital as it will allow the validity of the website. 

</p>

<h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail?
</h2>
<p>
There are numerous reasons as to why digital projects fail. One of the main reason is due to the fact that projects do not have a structural process. This could be due to lack of research and not brainstorming the project in the planning phase. 

</p>
<p>
This can lead to multiple complications causing the project to be unsuccessful. Whilst developing a digital project, a company has to take various factors into account for it to be successful. For example, teamwork, time constraints and process planning are very important. If there is no process, it will be difficult to deliver the project on time and for it to be cost effective leading to failure of the project. Therefore, It is imperative to have a structure and to divide the project between the team into small manageable tasks. This will allow the project to be developed efficiently and on time.
</p>
<p>
Other issues causing a digital project to fail involves poor communication between team members, lack of delegating tasks and not reviewing and testing the end product. If companies do not test their products they will not be able to find faults which can lead to vulnerabilities such as bugs, mistakes, and the failure of the product. Another factor could be due to lack of marketing and sales promotion alongside consumer feedback. This is vital for any digital project as consumer feedback allows room for improvements to be implemented. All the above elements if not taken into consideration will cause a digital project to fail.

</p>

<h2>
1.5 how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?
</h2>

<p>
In order to select the proposed IT system and software it is necessary to take into account numerous factors when deciding what IT system and software are to be used for the project. The choice is to use a laptop, the reason being that they are user friendly and easy to use. They are considered portable as they can be taken anywhere. I have decided to use the windows operating system over mac as I find windows to be the more practical operating system.
</p>

<p>
When starting a project, I prefer to plan, structure and brainstorm. In order to do this I utilise the use of google docs and evernote for writing down my ideas. For managing the project I will access my Trello boards as it helps me break down the project into manageable tasks. VS code is my first preference when coding as I look for simple and efficient code editors, this is believed to be user friendly and practical to operate.  
</p>

<h2>
1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.
</h2>

<p>
My chosen technologies have been beneficial in assisting me to achieve my outcomes. The Thinkpad laptop with windows operating system had provided me with efficiency, mobility, and convenience. The VS code editor had allowed me to smoothly write my code for the project and allowed me to be efficient with my time.

</p>
<p>
Trello has helped me greatly with the overall management of the project. I had used the board with the kanban method therefore I was allowed to breakdown the project into small manageable tasks. This allowed me to organise and approach each situation alongside adding each new task while building the website. Alongside Trello, Slack was a tool that provided efficiency in communicating and file sharing with other members of the team. 

</p>

<p>
Whilst working on my project it was necessary to create the repository on GitHub. Git provided me with a version control system that kept these revisions straight, storing the modifications in a central repository. This allowed me to develop my project easily while allowing collaborating with my colleagues, as they can download a new version of the software, make changes, and upload the newest revision. Everyone who is allowed access can see these changes and contribute where necessary.

</p>

<h2>
1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?

</h2>


<P>
There are many legal guidelines and constraints that can impact digital projects. One of the most important guidelines can be considered is General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This is known as a European regulation that came into effect on the 25th of May 2018 and is recognised across the entire EU region. The effect of this legislation allows individuals to have a sense of control over their data in regards to companies exploiting them.  

</P>

<p>
The passing of this legislation has had a huge impact on digital projects as companies need to take into account data privacy and security standards when creating digital projects. Many online services now require consent when asking for data, whether the user is willing to provide the website with data e.g email, name and address. The regulation also prevents companies from  collecting and storing data on the basis that they may need it in the future therefore showing that <a href="https://www.superoffice.com/blog/gdpr/">GDPR</a>


makes it easier for individuals to withdraw consent for their data. When creating digital projects this will have an impact as these are standards that need to be taken into account therefore one should map companies data and determine what data is required and should be kept in any online service being provided.

</p>

<p>
The GDPR also encourages organisations to improve cybersecurity and to keep on developing their measures in order to decrease the risk of any data breach. This will have an impact on a digital project, as you need to take into account the consequences that will occur if someone's data gets breached therefore good security measures need to be implemented to prevent this.
