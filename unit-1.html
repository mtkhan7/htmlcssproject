      <h2>1.1 Purpose of Information Technology in modern business</h2>
      <p>
        I.T has a huge purpose and value in modern businesses. In recent years
        the purpose of I.T in modern businesses have played a big role in
        companies being more productive by using state of the art software and
        hardware in automating the process required by businesses. Information
        Technology has enabled big companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google
        to solve complex problems at a quicker pace.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is benefit for businesses when using I.T as companies are able to
        use improved hardware such as more memory, faster processor and more
        storage. This allows them to be able to complete multiple tasks at a
        quicker rate which would allow them to be cost efficient and make more
        sales which will lead to more profit for the business.
      </p>

      <p>
        Implementing the use of Information technology in businesses have also
        allowed them to make better decisions by doing market research online or
        offline and efficiently obtaining data with utilising applications like
        <a href="https://dynamics.microsoft.com/" target="_blank"
          >Microsoft CRM Dynamics</a
        >
        <a href="https://analytics.google.com/" target="_blank"
          >Google Analytics</a

          >[2]</a
        >
        .This will enable the business to be able to identify what their
        customers needs and wants are and how they can supply them with products
        fitting their demand. By doing this the business would be able to
        provide products which customers prefer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Information technology has also resulted in improving customer support
        by utilising multiple channels such as smartphones, emails, social media
        platforms. There are also cloud technologies which are easily available
        today and have helped many businesses be able to manage their resources
        in an efficient manner, cut costs and have allowed their employees to
        use any devices anywhere in the world to access their enterprise
        software
        <a

        >. Businesses are able to be well organised and have a systematic
        structure allowing them to be more cost efficient. Due to high
        competition in the business sector, being cost efficient will give
        businesses the upper hand and it is evident by companies such as Apple
        and Samsung, having advanced I.T features allows them to take control of
        the market and therefore having huge market share in smartphones

        1.2 methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects
        successfully
      </h2>
      <p>
        Since digital projects require a lot of time and attention there are
        numerous skills and tools which are essential to complete these tasks
        successfully. There should be a detailed plan for implementation of the
        idea

          [1]</a
        >, this is essential as you are able to plan in manageable steps.
        Planning is crucial as a digital project would require an individual to
        face multiple scenarios and a plan allows one to be time efficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        A digital project being produced in regards to a client, it is essential
        to understand the requirements, time constraints and costs and
        limitations of the project. Clients have demands which have to be met in
        order for the project to be successful. Therefore being aware of the
        requirements and understanding how to accomplish them is an essential
        skill to complete a project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Digital projects have a number of different forms, such as a web
        application or a desktop app. It is crucial to be aware of what
        technologies or development stack to use specifically for the product
        and whether there needs to be a collaboration with user design and
        development teams. Alongside being aware of this, having interpersonal
        and teamwork skills to deal with clients or your team is also an
        essential skill in order to achieve a successful digital project. This
        would therefore require good knowledge of communication tools such as
        slack, flock, google hangout that allow messaging, file and code sharing
        between teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having knowledge of tools such as
        <a href="http://www.trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</a>
        <a href="http://www.asana.com" target="_blank"> Asana</a>
        <a href="http://www.monday.com" target="_blank">Monday</a> for project
        management in conjunction with the use of Agile software development
        methodologies such as Kanban and Scrum

        </a>
        are a necessity in order to achieve a successful project. These tools
        aid in the planning,development, testing and the deployment of the end
        product . Other tools such as draw.io and lucidchart allow the creation
        of diagrams and flowcharts for the product. This would once again be
        time efficient and allow the needs of the client to be met efficiently.

        <a href="http://javascript.info" target="_blank">Javascript</a> and
        <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com" target="_blank">C++</a> for coding
        and developing the product. After developing the product, you must test
        the product and in order to do this, one must require knowledge of
        different tools and skills such as reviewing peer code, bug testing,
        usability testing and use of testing applications

        1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How
        will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.
      </h2>
      <p>
        In order to develop my website, I will devise a plan by brainstorming
        the structure and design of the website either on paper or using a tool
        such as draw.io. This will allow me to create a diagram and a user
        interface of the front end which will identify where each element is
        positioned on the website e.g content, navigation, links, images and
        buttons. In order for efficient and effective development of my website,
        I will break down the project into small manageable tasks. I will use
        trello with the kanban method for tracking my progress. This will allow
        me to prioritise important aspects of the website development, allowing
        me to finish the website within my designated time and updating the
        board as I progress.

        The website will be coded in VS Code editor. On completion of the
        website, I will review the code and start testing each function for
        bugs. This is vital as it will allow the validity of the website.

      <h2>
        1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes
        digital projects to fail?
      </h2>
      <p>
        There are numerous reasons as to why digital projects fail. One of the
        main reason is due to the fact that projects do not have a structural
        process. This could be due to lack of research and not brainstorming the
        project in the planning phase. This can lead to multiple complications
        causing the project to be unsuccessful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whilst developing a digital project, a company has to take various
        factors into account for it to be successful. For example, teamwork,
        time constraints and process planning are very important. If there is no
        process, it will be difficult to deliver the project on time and for it
        to be cost effective leading to failure of the project. Therefore, It is
        imperative to have a structure and to divide the project between the
        team into small manageable tasks. This will allow the project to be
        developed efficiently and on time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other issues causing a digital project to fail involves poor
        communication between team members, lack of delegating tasks and not
        reviewing and testing the end product. If companies do not test their
        products they will not be able to find faults which can lead to
        vulnerabilities such as bugs, mistakes, and the failure of the product.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another factor could be due to lack of marketing and sales promotion
        alongside consumer feedback. This is vital for any digital project as
        consumer feedback allows room for improvements to be implemented. All
        the above elements if not taken into consideration will cause a digital
        project to fail.

        1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital
        projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?
      </h2>
      <p>
        There are many legal guidelines and constraints that can impact digital
        projects. One of the most important guidelines can be considered is
        General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This is known as a European
        regulation that came into effect on the 25th of May 2018 and is
        recognised across the entire EU region. The effect of this legislation
        allows individuals to have a sense of control over their data in regards
        to companies exploiting them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The passing of this legislation has had a huge impact on digital
        projects as companies need to take into account data privacy and
        security standards when creating digital projects. Many online services
        now require consent when asking for data, whether the user is willing to
        provide the website with data e.g email, name and address. The
        regulation also prevents companies from  collecting and storing data on
        the basis that they may need it in the future therefore showing that
        GDPR makes it easier for individuals to withdraw consent for their data.
        When creating digital projects this will have an impact as these are
        standards that need to be taken into account therefore one should map
        companies data and determine what data is required and should be kept in
        any online service being provided.
