            I am Mo,<br />
            I am an aspiring software developer and a huge fan of World Of
            Warcraft game. Since an early age, I have had a great interest
            within technology and a passion to pursue a career in software
            developing. I am fascinated by how technology is now a vital part in
            our lives and is constantly changing. I have experience of working
            in multiple positions such as providing technical support and
            customer service. Currently, I feel I am at a level in my career
            where I would like to further develop and challenge myself to learn
            software development. I feel that to enhance one's own knowledge, a
            change of environment is fundamental in doing so therefore taking
            the opportunity to learn software development at Code Nation was
            ideal.

            <br />
            My experience at Code Nation has been highly productive. I have
            gained an insight in many areas such as best practices in coding and
            development. I have actively applied my gained knowledge in coding
            and project management into practice through completing tasks such
            as developing a game in collaboration with other colleagues. I have
            developed a web page and have a better understanding of how theory
            underpins practice regarding web development. Which will further
            enhance my knowledge for pursuing a career in this field.
