    <h2>
      2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in
      making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?
    </h2>
    <p>
      I am very satisfied with the tools that I have used whilst developing my
      website. By using Visual studio code, I was able to write and test my code
      to see if it was functioning therefore allowing me to produce an
      effective, well working and user friendly website. During the development
      of the website, primarily I decided to use notepad to plan my website,
      however I was finding that I was unable to store information in an
      organised manner, therefore I used a change approach by switching to
      Trello. This had assisted me greatly when applying the kanban method,
      allowing me to be efficient in project planning. By applying the above
      tools I was able to create a systematic approach towards producing the
      website and allowed me to consume my time effectively.
    </p>

    <h2>
      2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate
    </h2>
    <p>
      The above tools chosen in 2.1 have been beneficial in assisting me to
      achieve a well developed website. The VS code editor had allowed me to
      efficiently write my code for the project and enabled me to produce an
      effective and well working website. The Thinkpad laptop with windows
      operating system had provided me with efficiency, mobility, and
      convenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the overall management of the project, I found Trello to be more
      practical, simple and efficient than my primary choice of notepad. I
      utilised the board with the kanban method, allowing me to breakdown the
      project into small manageable tasks. By using these tools, I was extremely
      satisfied with my choice as it helped me to organise and approach
      situations alongside adding and changing each new task whilst building the
      website.
    </p>
    <h2>
      2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your ﬁnal project – are you
      happy with your website?
    </h2>
    <p>
      When evaluating the end result of my website, there were many strengths
      and weaknesses identified. The strengths highlighted that the overall
      finishing design of the website was user friendly, clearly stating the
      message it wanted to convey. The website had a secure hosting service
      provided through github. The website is presented in a flex box based
      layout, this allowed me to display information in sections allowing a
      better looking design. However the content displayed could have been
      improved with images, infographics and videos. Due to the time constraint
      I was unable to make the website responsive and mobile friendly. Another
      weakness is that the information provided was too cluttered together. This
      made it difficult for users to read. Despite being satisfied with the
      tools used, I could have improved the website by adding more content,
      better design and smooth navigation.
    </p>

    <h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>
    <p>
      Taking into account my current strength and weaknesses of my website there
      are numerous improvements I would implement to my project. The area that
      needed the most improvement is the design. I could have improved the
      website by providing more colour as that can enhance a users experience.
      Also to make it effective I would have given white space between words to
      present an uncluttered look. Another change I would have implemented is to
      make the website mobile friendly. This can allow me to provide a more
      responsive layout and adjust it to different screen sizes.
    </p>
    <h2>
      2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are ﬁt for
      purpose
    </h2>
    <p>
      Reviewing the outcomes after implementing the changes to improve the
      website. I found the modifications above practical and efficient to use.
      The colours and content that I added to the website will allow an
      enhancing experience for users. Changing the file formats of images from
      jpeg to png allowed for fast loading graphics. I have now included jump
      and navigation links for users to easily navigate through different pages.
      In conclusion, I have tested the website and I have found it to be fully
      functional and error free.
