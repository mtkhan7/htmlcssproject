    <h2>
      1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page
    </h2>

    <p>
      The website I have developed has a variety of content. There are 6 pages
      linked to the website. The Index page contains a logo situated at the top
      alongside the navigation bar linking it to different pages on the website.
      The navigation bar is displayed on above all of the web pages. It has a
      drop down menu linking to unit 1 and unit 2 outcome pages. The index page
      consists of h1 text and a button element with a gradient background which
      links to the about me page. The about me page contains a h1 element with a
      background image which includes content with regards to myself and has two
      images such as an illustration of a person working on his laptop
      displaying that he is coding and a codenation logo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unit 1 and 2 outcome pages include content referring to various
      content with regards to IT solution, software developing and how I formed
      my website. The review page contains information with regards to the
      evaluation of how I designed the website, identifying strengths and
      weaknesses. The final page refers to references that I used within my
      portfolio. There are social media icons located on the footer of each
      page. I have used a variety of colours and fonts to enhance the appearance
      of my website.
    </p>

    <h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>

    <p>
      There are many constraints affecting websites. One constraint is known as
      Copyright. This is defined as the right given to a creator who has
      produced an original content or product. The individual who has created
      that content has the rights to reproduce, display or sell copies of the
      work to other people. Trademarks are another constraint as companies can
      register and protect their brand by law from being used by other
      individuals/companies without their consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      constraints are visible on websites as when content is placed online
      especially on private domains, individuals are not entitled to use that
      content for personal or business use without their permission. It is
      always best practice to ask for permission from original authors when
      using their content. However, there are royalty free content that
      individuals can freely use for their work on their website which may
      require referencing the original creator.
    </p>

    <h2>
      1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe
      issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how
      we can overcome them
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are many access issues that need to be taken into consideration when
      developing a website for people with disability. If someone with a vision
      impairment accesses a website they may have difficulty looking and
      understanding the information provided. In order to overcome this, it is
      beneficial to use alt tags. Disabled individuals tend to use a screen
      reader which reads text on a website, and therefore alt tags allow images
      to contain words which are read aloud. Another important disability to
      take into account when designing web pages are colorblind users. They find
      it difficult to view certain colours, therefore practicing smart color
      choices is essential for a website with a wide audience. To overcome this,
      it will be beneficial to use black text on a white background as this will
      be readable for most users.
    </p>

    <h2>
      1.7 Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites
    </h2>

    <p>
      There are many files that can be used for websites. The most common one is
      HTML which is used for structuring web pages. Another common file type
      that is used is CSS. This is mainly used for styling of the web page as it
      allows the creator to use different colours, fonts and layouts. Javascript
      is a popular file type, it is essential for changing the behaviour of the
      web page. It allows interactive use on the website. Choosing the right
      file format to save images is essential. This can be done by using PNG and
      JPeg files. This allows a small but effective fast loading graphics. It
      supports advanced features such as a 24 bit colour support which supports
      alpha channel transparency.
